This code is a bunch of wrappers that allow sklearn pipelines to get and output pandas dataframes (and not numpy arrays)
such that the metadata remains.
The pipeline.ipynb is a detailed example for how to use the pipeline.

The code is inspired by many tutorials online and on scikit-learn pipelines.
